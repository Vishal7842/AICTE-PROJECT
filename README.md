Introduction
Steganography is a technique used to conceal the existence of a message, allowing for secure communication without drawing attention. This repository aims to provide insights into the methods and applications of steganography.

Problem Statement
In an era of increasing digital surveillance and data breaches, there is a pressing need for secure communication methods. Traditional encryption can be detected, revealing the existence of hidden messages. This project explores how steganography can address these challenges.

Technology Used
Techniques:

Least Significant Bit (LSB) Insertion: Modifies the least significant bits of pixel values in images to embed secret data.
Transform Domain Techniques: Hides data in the frequency domain of images, such as using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) in JPEG images.
Audio Steganography: Hides data within audio files by altering sound waves.
Video Steganography: Embeds data in video files by manipulating frames.
Tools:

Steghide
OpenStego
Custom scripts in Python or Java
